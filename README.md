#  House Price Prediction App

This is a machine learning web application that predicts house sale prices based on key property features. It uses a **Random Forest Regressor** model trained on historical data and provides an interactive **Streamlit** interface for easy use.



##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow:
- Data preprocessing and model training using scikit-learn  
- Saving the trained model and selected feature list  
- Building a Streamlit web app for live predictions  
- User-friendly UI to input property details and estimate sale prices



##  Files Included

- `train_model.py`: Script to train the Random Forest model on the dataset (`train.csv`) and save the model and features.
- `app.py`: Streamlit web app allowing users to input property details and get predictions.
- `house_price_model.pkl`: Serialized trained model file (generated by `train_model.py`).
- `features.pkl`: List of feature names used during model training.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.



##  Setup Instructions
